# Summary
8 years ago the region was wracked with magical storms. Bright lights akin to the Northern Lights lit the sky for a week and the seas raged.

When the environment cooled down the landscape had changed. Isle Keltos and a number of other small islands had disappeared. It was shortly discovered a number of new islands had arrived. Populated by a strange folk.

3 planes of existence had collided. Caused by all three mining the same vein of Manavine. This planar collision spat out the majority of the islands in the archipelago into the same plane of existence. 

There are three factions from the three planes. Our players are from Golarion a faction primarily ruled by a consortium of elves and humans although other races are present.

One of the other factions are the Hastellen primarily dwarves who are less magically inclined but rely on automatons and technology instead.

The third faction the Vey'Zyrenn are significantly more magical and ocean going. They work in synconicity with the sea and the tides and weather. They live in a combination of above ground and underwater settlements.

As we proceed the players discover that things are getting worse and the Azura isles have fallen out of the stable state that they have been in and have been isolated.
