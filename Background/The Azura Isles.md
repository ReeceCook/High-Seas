# History
The Azura Isles were settled after the discovery of Manavine in 703. 
The tectonic activity causes the rock to rise up towards the surface and be found in much greater concentrations than the rest of the continent.

Explorers found the gemstone scattered around Isle Keltos and a short investigation led them to set up an early mining expedition.

Conditions on Isle Keltos caused this initial settlement to fail but shortly after Veyluna was settled. Although Manavine is not found on Veyluna the good weather and natual harbours made it an obvious choice for a place to settle.

80 years later Port Nymara has grown into a bustling hub supporting not only the mining efforts but a significant portion of the population that has grown around the industry.
