## Starting Point: Anywhere

### The Dying Smuggler
![[ChatGPT Image Apr 14, 2025, 02_29_18 PM.png]]
In a shadowy corner of a tavern, the players notice an older human male clutching his side, clearly injured. When approached, Captain Dorian Blackwater, a notorious smuggler known for moving contraband between factions, beckons them closer.

"Been poisoned... rival crew," he gasps. "Not long for this world. My life's work... my greatest score... all wasted unless..."

He offers them a weathered leather map case containing:

- A detailed map to an unmarked island
- A journal describing various traps and their solutions
- A special key with Manavine fragments embedded in the handle

"Twenty years collecting treasures from these Isles... artifacts even they don't know the value of. It's all there... just waiting. Take half... just make sure my crew gets the rest."

### The Setup

- The smuggler dies shortly after this exchange
- Local rumors confirm Blackwater was a master smuggler who disappeared for months at a time
- His rival, Captain Silas Vane, is also searching for Blackwater's legendary stash
- The Golarion authorities would be interested in recovering stolen artifacts

## The Journey

### Navigation Challenges

The map leads to an unmarked island in a remote part of the Azura Isles. Getting there requires:

- Deciphering Blackwater's personal nautical code
- Navigating through treacherous reef formations
- Avoiding Vane's ship which is following at a distance
- Strange storm formations that seem to appear and disappear unnaturally

### First Signs of Trouble

As they approach the island, they notice:

- Unusual purple lightning striking around the central mountain
- Parts of the coastline that don't match the map (recent collapses)
- An abandoned Hastellen mining vessel partially sunk offshore

## The Island: Blackwater's Haven

### Initial Exploration

The island features:

- A hidden cove where Blackwater docked his ship (now empty)
- Evidence of recent Manavine mining operations that weren't on the map
- Periodic tremors shaking the island
- Strange crystal formations growing where they shouldn't be

### Blackwater's Traps (As Described in the Journal)

1. **The False Path** - A seemingly obvious trail marked with old pirate symbols that leads to deadfall traps
2. **The Guardian Spring** - A water source guarded by poison dart mechanisms
3. **The Echo Chamber** - A cave where speaking above a whisper triggers falling rocks
4. **The Loyal Crew** - Animated skeletal remains of Blackwater's former crew who attack unless shown the captain's key

### The Manavine Complication

As players navigate these expected traps, they discover evidence that something else is wrong:

- The tremors are growing stronger and more frequent
- Cracks in the ground emit strange Manavine-infused vapors
- They find journals from Hastellen miners warning about "structural instability" and "crystalline propagation"
- Sections of Blackwater's mapped route have collapsed into newly formed chasms

## The Vault and the Canyon

### The Approach

Blackwater's treasure vault is built into an ancient temple at the island's center. However:

- The final approach is now a series of stone and wooden bridges spanning a massive canyon that wasn't there when Blackwater made his map
- Evidence suggests illegal Manavine mining beneath the temple caused the ground to collapse
- The canyon floor glows with exposed Manavine veins
- Periodic energy discharges from the Manavine cause sections of the remaining structures to crumble

### The Vault Challenge

The vault itself is:

- Built on what is now effectively a large platform suspended over the center of the canyon
- Connected to land by deteriorating bridges
- Protected by a complex lock mechanism requiring the special key
- Showing signs of instability with cracks spreading across its foundation

## The Final Confrontation

Just as the players reach the vault platform:

1. **The Rival Appears** - Captain Silas Vane and his crew arrive, having followed the players
2. **The Double-Cross** - Vane reveals he poisoned Blackwater and demands the key
3. **Environmental Danger** - A major tremor hits, causing sections of the platform to break away
4. **Boss Battle** - The fight takes place on the crumbling platform as:
    - Sections fall away after being damaged or when tremors hit
    - Manavine energy discharges create additional hazards
    - Vane uses the unstable environment to his advantage (pushing players toward crumbling edges)
    - Some of Vane's crew might fall to their deaths, emphasizing the danger

### Battle Environment Mechanics

- The platform initially has 9-12 sections
- Each round, roll to see if a tremor causes 1-2 sections to fall
- Manavine discharges create temporary obstacles or cause additional damage
- Vane carries a weapon infused with Manavine that can cause additional structural damage
- Players can use actions to stabilize sections of the platform (buying time)

## The Treasure and Escape

If the players defeat Vane and access the vault, they find:

- A collection of faction artifacts (historical importance rather than magical power)
- A small fortune in gems and coins
- Blackwater's personal journal revealing he discovered evidence of someone deliberately causing the planar collision
- A strange device of unknown origin that seems to stabilize Manavine energy (plot hook for your main story)

As they claim their prize, the entire structure begins to collapse. The escape becomes a skill challenge as they race back across falling bridges while the island starts sinking into the sea.

## Aftermath and Connections

- The treasure provides wealth and potential faction connections (returning stolen artifacts)
- Blackwater's journal offers clues about the main plot
- The stabilization device could be of interest to all three factions
- The island's collapse creates a new navigation hazard in the region
- Surviving members of Vane's crew might become recurring enemies

This quest provides action, exploration, treasure hunting, and contributes to your overall plot while giving you that dramatic crumbling platform battle as the centerpiece.
