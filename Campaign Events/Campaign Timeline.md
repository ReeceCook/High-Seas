At this point someone asks the party for help finding a manavine cache left over from a long dead civilization a 4 plane. Supposedly a long dead pirate king went hunting for it.

The party finds a ship with an old automaton on it. SM-33. "Can't Say I remember No At Attin"
Party fixes up the ship and get there own ship and make it there own. They start the quest. They go to a pirate city and everyone laughs saying At Attin is a fairy tale. 

They go meet a stars expert who gives them some cordinates.

The cordinates lead to the At Achran which has the cordinates to the other manavine caches However the At Attin cords have be scorched. It looks to be an automaton weapon and SM-33 reveal he remembers scorching them but had his memory wiped.

SM-33 will take the group to the hidden base at skull island.
But alas it turns out to be a Spa.

They make there way down into the basement and fidn the actual pirate base. Lots of booby traps and stuff. But they find the cords for the manavine

It turns out the ship they have is the key for breaching terrible winds before finding the cache and being able to bring it back and provide energy and magic for the groups to make food water and power.

At this point they need to work out who the main culprit is:





- Move into needing to find out who and how caused the planar collision. {5th Level}
- 
- Mystery investigation into that.
- Once we find that out need to handle and take down that problem and find some way to restore the connection
- Maybe some sort of planar gates to finish the campaign.


Is this piratey enough?
Do we need a classic pirate subplot.
