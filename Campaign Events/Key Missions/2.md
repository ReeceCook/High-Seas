# The Tempest's Bounty

## Mission Briefing

Lieutenant Commander Alys Baird calls the players to her office in Fort Forseth. This time, the meeting is less formal - she's reviewing supply manifests as they enter.

"Good work with the monastery situation," she says without looking up. "I have another task for you - straightforward this time. The naval supply ship _Tempest's Bounty_ docked at Veyluna Harbor last night with specialized equipment for the fort. I need you to collect a sealed crate marked with the Azure Navy insignia and bring it back here."

She finally looks up, sliding a document across her desk. "This requisition form authorizes the transfer. Harbormaster Jorvin Ledger will direct you to the right berth. Should be simple enough."

As the players turn to leave, she adds with a hint of suspicion in her voice, "One more thing - there have been reports of unusual activity around the docks lately. Keep your eyes open."

## Journey to Veyluna Harbor

The trip to Veyluna provides opportunities to:

- Encounter merchants discussing trade disruptions
- Notice increased security around the harbor
- Overhear rumors about sailors going missing
- See one of the Hastellen loading cranes malfunctioning, causing a minor commotion

## Veyluna Harbor

The harbor is bustling with activity from all three factions:

- Golarion sailing ships unloading exotic goods
- The two newly-installed Hastellen loading cranes working alongside dwarven engineers
- Vey'Zyrenn traders with unusual aquatic wares and creatures in the Harbor Market

### Key Locations at the Harbor:

1. **Harbormaster's Office** - A square, two-story building with a copper dome where Harbormaster Jorvin Ledger works
2. **The Tempest's Bounty** - A weathered Golarion naval supply vessel docked at the Golarion-Style Quay
3. **The Siren's Call** - The three-story tavern built from repurposed ship timbers where sailors gather
4. **The General Warehouses** - Nine large structures arranged in a horseshoe pattern
5. **The Harbor Temple** - Where priests have been monitoring strange planar energies
6. **The Maze** - The Eastern Residential District with its winding streets and "The Undertow" smuggler tunnels

## The Initial Fetch Quest

When players present their requisition at the Harbormaster's Office, they discover:

- Harbormaster Jorvin Ledger is "unavailable" according to his Hastellen automaton assistant, Cog, who seems to be processing paperwork with unusual haste
- The paperwork for the _Tempest's Bounty_ is "being processed"
- They're directed to "The Forge" (Warehouse 6) where the crate with Hastellen components should be held

At "The Forge", players find:

- No sign of the Azure Navy crate
- A dock worker named Mira who seems excessively interested in their business
- Evidence of recent activity (wet footprints, a dropped manifest with crossed-out entries)
- Other Hastellen metals and components, but not the specific crate they need

## Investigation Phase

As players investigate the missing crate, they can:

1. **Question Dock Workers**
    - Most give vague answers about shipment delays
    - One drunk sailor at The Siren's Call (in the boisterous ground floor) mentions seeing "hooded figures" at the docks after hours
    - Morlen Tidewalker, the one-eyed tavern proprietor, confides that he's noticed unusual activity around the Trident Consortium's private warehouses
2. **Track Down the Ship's Crew**
    - The captain seems evasive about the crate's contents when found at the second floor of The Siren's Call
    - A nervous crewmember can be persuaded to reveal that "certain cargo" was diverted by people claiming to be representatives of the "Trident Consortium" wearing blue and silver uniforms
3. **Search for Harbormaster Ledger**
    - He's not at home in the Northern Residential District ("The Heights") or his usual haunts
    - His office contains a hidden ledger with coded entries in the basement archive
    - Cog, if properly questioned, reveals that the Harbormaster has been acting strangely since visiting "The Quarantine" (Warehouse 9)
4. **Consult the Harbor Temple**
    - High Priest Korem Wavecaller recognizes strange symbols the players have noticed as related to ancient sea deities
    - The priests reveal that their monitoring of planar energies has shown increased disturbances near the private warehouses
5. **Stake Out the Docks at Night**
    - Observe dockhands with strange tattoos meeting secretly near the Manavine Marker
    - See them moving cargo through "The Undertow" tunnels accessible from The Maze
    - Notice blue lights emanating from the Trident Consortium's private warehouses

## The Cult Revealed

The players discover that a faction of dock workers belong to "The Abyssal Tide" - a cult dedicated to an entity they believe is responsible for the strange storms and planar phenomena. They've been stealing specific cargo they believe contains "signs and portents."

### The Cultist Hideout

Located beneath one of the Trident Consortium's private warehouses, accessible through "The Undertow" tunnels or via an underwater passage from their small private dock.

**Features include:**

- A meeting chamber with strange symbols etched into the walls
- Stolen cargo from various ships, including the Azure Navy crate
- A disturbing altar made from Manavine shards and driftwood
- A crude map showing locations of magical disturbances across the isles
- Items from "The Quarantine" (Warehouse 9) that were supposed to be sealed due to planar contamination

**Cult Members:**

- Mostly ordinary dock workers who believe they're "preparing for the coming convergence"
- Led by Harbormaster Jorvin Ledger, who wears ceremonial robes when conducting rituals
- Several members of the Trident Consortium, explaining their interest in Manavine research
- A mysterious figure known as "The Voice of the Deep" who communicates through a Manavine crystal

## Resolution Options

1. **Direct Confrontation:**
    - Battle with cultists in their hideout
    - Possibility of Ledger escaping through the private dock if not properly cornered
    - Risk of damage to the Azure Navy crate
    - Potential for the Hastellen loading cranes to be activated as weapons by the cultists
2. **Stealth Approach:**
    - Infiltrate during a ritual when most cultists are distracted
    - Opportunity to overhear crucial information about their beliefs
    - Retrieve the crate without alerting the entire cult
    - Use the diversion of the Night Market in The Maze as cover
3. **Infiltration:**
    - Pretend to join the cult to learn more
    - Discover that some members aren't evil, just frightened by recent events
    - Opportunity to fracture the cult from within
    - Learn about the true nature of the Trident Consortium
4. **Official Intervention:**
    - Return to Alys Baird with evidence before taking action
    - Lead a coordinated raid with naval personnel
    - More resources but less opportunity for subtlety
    - Potential to expose powerful members of Veyluna society

## The Mysterious Crate

When recovered, the crate contains:

- A sophisticated Hastellen device for measuring planar energy fluctuations
- Notes from a Vey'Zyrenn scholar about increasing "planar thinning"
- A sealed letter for Alys Baird from a mysterious contact
- A small fragment of pure Manavine similar to the one displayed at the Manavine Marker

## Consequences & Rewards

- **Cult Defeated:** Alys rewards the players with enhanced naval authority and access to restricted areas
- **Cult Dispersed:** Some cultists escape but their operation is disrupted; grateful merchants from the Harbor Market provide discounts
- **Cult Infiltrated:** Players gain valuable intelligence and potential informants among remaining cultists
- **Trident Consortium Exposed:** The players gain a reputation among the elite of Veyluna Harbor, potentially gaining access to the "Blue Coin Club" in The Heights

## Deeper Mystery Elements

Regardless of approach, players discover:

- The cult has accurate predictions about where new planar disturbances will occur
- Their ritual texts contain fragments of genuine arcane knowledge about planar boundaries
- The "Voice of the Deep" appears to have knowledge of the original planar collision
- A connection between the planar disturbances and the Manavine substance

## Return to Fort Forseth

When players return to Alys Baird with the crate and information about the cult:

- She's disturbed by the contents of the sealed letter
- She reveals that similar cults have appeared on other islands
- She promotes the players to a special investigation unit under her direct command
- She recommends they keep an eye on the Trident Consortium's activities going forward

This quest transitions from a simple fetch mission to uncovering a conspiracy, while furthering the campaign's main plot about the planar collision. It also sets up the players for future missions investigating the growing cult presence across the Azura Isles.

## Additional Hook Ideas for Follow-up Adventures

1. The players discover that items in "The Toybox" (Warehouse 8) might be connected to the cult's prophecies
2. High Priest Korem Wavecaller requests the players' help with a ritual to stabilize the planar energies
3. Lord Tavin Duskrender from Silverwake Manor has gone missing after investigating the Trident Consortium
4. The "Voice of the Deep" begins communicating directly with one of the players through dreams
5. The Hastellen loading cranes start operating on their own, creating a pattern that matches the cult's symbols
