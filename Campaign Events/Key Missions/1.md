## Mission Briefing

Lieutenant Commander Alys Baird summons the players to her office in Fort Forseth - a weathered chamber with naval maps covering the walls and a large table displaying the local isles.

>*"The Monastery of Tranquil Waters on nearby Cerulean Isle has been overrun by goblins," she explains, pointing to a small island marked on the map. "The monks practice a peaceful order dedicated to Desna and have retreated here after the goblins pushed them out. They've requested our assistance in reclaiming their sacred grounds."*
>
>*Baird continues with a thoughtful frown, "Something seems off about this incursion. These waters rarely see goblin activity. I need you to investigate thoroughly before taking action. The Azure Navy expects both effectiveness and discretion."*

The Party can find the monks in the Red Lobster.

- **Brother Lamont** - The elderly head monk who explains the situation. "We awoke three days ago to screaming and chaos. Small green creatures had infiltrated our sanctuary. We fled with what little we could carry."
- **Sela Markwin** - A village elder who offers additional information: "Those goblins came from the northern hills. They've never bothered us before - something must have driven them here."
## Journey to Cerulean Isle

The short voyage provides an opportunity to showcase the beauty and dangers of the Azura Isles:

- Strange weather patterns that seem to shift unnaturally
- Brief glimpses of exotic sea creatures not native to these waters
- A strange shimmer in the sky that locals call "the Veil" (subtle foreshadowing of the planar isolation)

## Investigation Options

Players can gather information through:

1. Interviewing villagers (reveals rumors of strange roaring sounds from the hills)
2. Scouting the monastery from a distance (reveals goblins acting strangely - they seem to be fortifying rather than looting)
3. Tracking goblin movements (reveals signs of a hasty relocation, not an invasion force)
## The Monastery

The ancient stone monastery sits on a cliff overlooking the sea. Its architecture shows influence from both Golarion and Vey'Zyrenn styles.

**Goblin Occupation:**

- Approximately 12-15 goblins led by a goblin shaman named Zibbit
- They've barricaded the entrance and set crude traps
- They're using the monastery as a refuge, not as a raiding base

## Combat Approach

If players choose direct confrontation:

- Initial goblin guards raise the alarm
- Goblins use the monastery's layout for ambushes and hit-and-run tactics
- The shaman Zibbit uses primitive magic focused on protection rather than offense
- Tactical elements include:
    - Narrow hallways limiting movement
    - A central courtyard perfect for ambushes
    - Sacred artifacts that could be damaged in the fight (creating consequences)

## Diplomatic Approach

Hints for peaceful resolution:

- Observant players notice the goblins have brought their young with them
- Some goblins appear injured
- They've set up living spaces, not just military positions
- Zibbit can be reasoned with and speaks broken Common
- If approached peacefully, Zibbit explains: "Big monster come! Smash homes! We run here. Safe walls."

## The True Threat

Whether through combat or diplomacy, players learn that an ogre named Grunch has claimed the caves where the goblins lived. The ogre is not native to this plane - he has strange markings and speaks of "falling through the sky" (another planar collision hint).

## Resolution Options

1. **The Combat Path:**
    - Defeat the goblins, then track down and battle the ogre
    - Return the monastery to the monks, who are grateful but troubled by the violence
2. **The Diplomatic Path:**
    - Negotiate with Zibbit to temporarily share the monastery with the monks
    - Together with goblins, confront the ogre (providing tactical advantage)
    - The monks offer to help the goblins establish a new settlement nearby

## Deeper Mystery Elements

Regardless of the solution, players discover unsettling details:

- The ogre has a strange crystalline growth on its back (a Manavine shard)
- Brother Lamont reveals ancient texts mentioning "the Convergence" - a prophesied time when "worlds would bleed together"
- The monastery contains a sealed chamber with frescoes depicting the three factions mining the same vein of Manavine across different planes
