# The Ironheart Accord

## Initial Briefing at Fort Forseth

Lieutenant Commander Alys Baird welcomes the players to a formal meeting where they're introduced to her superior, Admiral Reginald Huffington-Smythe - a pompous naval officer with an impeccably waxed mustache and a uniform adorned with far more medals than seem appropriate.

"Ah, yes, Baird's little task force," the Admiral says with a dismissive wave. "Splendid work with that cult business. Nasty business, cults. Never join one myself. Bad for the complexion."

After rambling about irrelevant naval regulations and his own accomplishments, he finally explains the situation:

"We have a diplomatic... situation with our Hastellen allies. Their Chancellor's daughter, Lady Emberlynn Cogsworth, has gone missing. The Hastellen believe we've kidnapped her! Preposterous! We need you to investigate discreetly, find the girl, and prevent a diplomatic incident that could jeopardize our alliance."

Alys adds quietly after the Admiral leaves: "The Admiral has somehow managed to make this situation worse by implying the Hastellen are being 'hysterical.' Be careful - the Hastellen are proud and technologically advanced. We need their cooperation if we're going to figure out what's happening to the Azura Isles."

## Journey to Mechanica Harbor

The voyage to the Hastellen side of the Azura Isles provides a stark contrast to the Golarion territories. Players observe:

- Hastellen ships powered by steam engines rather than sails
- Floating platforms with mechanical cranes and automatons
- The air becoming increasingly tinged with coal smoke and the scent of oil

Upon arrival at Mechanica Harbor, they're greeted by:

- Gleaming brass and bronze architecture
- Networks of pipes and gears visible throughout buildings
- Automatons performing labor alongside dwarves in formal, Victorian-inspired attire

## Meeting the Hastellen Officials

At the Municipal Authority Building, the players meet:

- **Chancellor Thaddeus Cogsworth** - A stern-faced dwarf with a mechanical monocle and an elaborate beard adorned with tiny gears. He's clearly worried beneath his formal demeanor.
- **Captain Brunhilde Steelwright** - Head of the Hastellen Security Forces, suspicious of the Golarions and doubtful of the players' abilities.
- **Prime Engineer Ferris Valveturner** - The Chancellor's chief advisor, who seems oddly hesitant when discussing Lady Emberlynn.

Chancellor Cogsworth explains: "My daughter Emberlynn disappeared three days ago. Her personal automatons were deactivated, and her quarters were left in disarray. A Golarion sailing ship was spotted near our waters that same night. We demand her safe return!"

## Investigation Phase

The players can gather information through various means:

1. **Lady Emberlynn's Quarters**
    - Her room contains:
        - Technical journals with notes about Manavine power applications
        - A hidden compartment with letters from someone signed only as "V"
        - A disassembled automaton with custom modifications
2. **Interviewing Hastellen Citizens**
    - Most express formal concern for their Chancellor's daughter
    - Some younger Hastellen hint that Emberlynn had "progressive ideas"
    - A clockwork shop apprentice nervously mentions Emberlynn frequented his shop for "unscheduled parts"
3. **The Local Social Scene**
    - At "The Brass Cog" social club:
        - Rumors that Emberlynn found traditional Hastellen society stifling
        - Whispers about a secret society called "The Free Gears" that advocates for social change
        - A rival noble family subtly suggests the Chancellor is hiding "embarrassing facts" about his daughter
4. **Following the Clues from the Letters**
    - The mysterious "V" arranged meetings at a location called "The Boundary"
    - References to "bridging two worlds" (which could be interpreted multiple ways)

## The Twist: Cross-Faction Romance

As players investigate deeper, they discover that Lady Emberlynn hasn't been kidnapped at all - she's eloped with a Vey'Zyrenn scholar named Varashiel. They've fallen in love while collaborating on Manavine research and plan to establish a joint Hastellen-Vey'Zyrenn research outpost at a neutral location.

This relationship is scandalous because:

1. Hastellen society values order and tradition, while Vey'Zyrenn culture embraces fluidity and change
2. The two factions have competing claims on certain Manavine deposits
3. Emberlynn is expected to marry into another prominent Hastellen family to secure a political alliance

## Finding "The Boundary"

The investigation leads to "The Boundary" - a small island in disputed territory between Hastellen and Vey'Zyrenn claims. Here, the lovers have established a small research outpost studying the planar effects of Manavine.

On the island, players find:

- A blend of Hastellen technology and Vey'Zyrenn magic
- Emberlynn and Varashiel working together happily
- Groundbreaking research on how Manavine acts as a conduit between planes
- Evidence that the couple knows something about the planar collision that they're keeping secret

## Diplomatic Challenges

When the couple is discovered, several parties converge on the island:

- Chancellor Cogsworth arrives with Hastellen guards, demanding his daughter's return
- Vey'Zyrenn representatives arrive to protect Varashiel
- The Admiral bumbles in with Golarion forces, nearly starting a three-way conflict

Players must navigate a tense diplomatic situation where they can:

1. Persuade the Chancellor to accept his daughter's choices
2. Highlight the importance of the couple's research to understanding the planar crisis
3. Negotiate a formal research agreement that benefits all three factions
4. Expose Admiral Huffington-Smythe's incompetence without creating a diplomatic incident

## Roleplay Opportunities with the Hastellen

This quest provides numerous opportunities to explore Hastellen culture:

- **Social Hierarchy:** Players learn about the rigid class structure based on technical achievement and family lineage
- **Technological Marvels:** Encounters with various automatons, mechanical devices, and steam-powered transportation
- **Traditions and Ceremonies:** Attending a formal Hastellen tea service with complex etiquette rules, or witnessing a "Gear Exchange Ceremony" that marks important agreements
- **Architecture and Design:** Exploring the brass-and-copper aesthetic of Hastellen buildings, with their intricate clockwork mechanisms and practical-yet-ornate styling
- **Values and Philosophy:** Discussions with various Hastellen citizens about their views on progress, tradition, and relations with other factions

## Resolution Options

1. **Diplomatic Success:**
    - Negotiate a sanctioned research partnership
    - Establish the outpost as a neutral zone for cooperation
    - Create a formal alliance between families rather than forcing marriage
2. **Partial Compromise:**
    - Emberlynn returns temporarily for appearances but continues her work secretly
    - The research continues under disguised funding
    - Players must help maintain the deception
3. **Revolutionary Change:**
    - Support Emberlynn and "The Free Gears" in challenging traditional Hastellen structures
    - Face potential backlash from conservative Hastellen elements
    - Create lasting social change but possible political instability

## The Deeper Plot

Regardless of the resolution, players discover:

- Emberlynn and Varashiel have documented evidence of intentional Manavine mining disruptions
- They've identified a pattern suggesting someone deliberately caused the planar collision
- Their research contains coordinates for an unmarked island that appeared after the most recent magical storm

When confronted, the couple reveals they fled not just for love, but because they discovered someone within the Hastellen leadership might be involved in deliberately destabilizing the planes.

## Return to Fort Forseth

Upon returning:

- Admiral Huffington-Smythe takes credit for the diplomatic "success"
- Alys Baird privately thanks the players and reveals she's been building a file on suspicious activities within the Azura Isles leadership
- The players receive a secret message from Emberlynn and Varashiel with coordinates to their next discovery

This adventure introduces the Hastellen faction through personal connections rather than combat, advances the main plot regarding the planar collision, and creates ongoing allies for the party. It also establishes the incompetence of the Admiral as a foil to Alys Baird's competence, setting up future political complications.
