### **Appearance**

A diminutive gnome with wild, frizzy white hair that sticks out like sea foam, a deeply lined face permanently squinting through a pair of cracked round spectacles, and eyes that sparkle with manic curiosity—one blue, one green. He wears a patchy expedition coat several sizes too big, cinched at the waist with twine, and covered in pinned leaves, feathers, and vials of glowing pollen. His walking staff is taller than he is and doubles as both a pointer and a field microscope. He smells faintly of salt, ink, and fermented fruit.

### **Personality**

Thaddeus is endlessly curious, absent-minded, and excitable to the point of manic energy. He’s prone to launching into long-winded explanations about animal morphology or arcane hybrid species. He’s fiercely kind but socially oblivious, occasionally forgetting basic etiquette if distracted by a rare creature or a new data point.

### **Background**

Once a respected scholar at the Royal Academy in [[Port Nymara]], Greelock became infamous after publishing **“[[The Spiral Descent]]”**, a controversial manuscript suggesting all life—mundane and magical—descended from shared proto-entities shaped by arcane environmental forces over time. Mocked by peers and subtly exiled, he funded his own expedition to the Azura Isles, believing the region's post-planar collision chaos will offer proof of his “[[arcanolutionary]]” theory.

He has strong ties to the [[Golarion Royal Court]] (a former royal tutor) and is occasionally funded by curious nobles or bored merchant princes looking for entertainment or prestige.

### **Motivations**

- Prove his theory of magical evolution before he dies.
- Catalogue every unique species in the Azura Isles.
- Discover the “Primal Catalyst”—a theoretical creature from which all others derive.
- Restore his academic reputation—or completely obliterate the current paradigm.

---

### **Skills and Abilities**

- **Investigator Skills**: Exceptional in Recall Knowledge, Arcana, Nature, and Occultism. Master in Research Lore and Biological Analysis.
- **Alchemical Tools**: Uses potions and elixirs to survive harsh terrain and study magical biology.
- **Druidic Dip (optional)**: Minor shapeshifting or commune with nature to support his theories with firsthand transformations.
- **Field Equipment**: Carries a specialized compass that reacts to planar energy, and a magical quill that draws what he sees.
- **Combat Style**: Avoids fighting if possible; when cornered, uses alchemical distractions, tanglefoot bags, and summoned beasts.

### **Quirks and Mannerisms**

- Frequently talks to his field journal like it’s a person.
- Names newly discovered species with ludicrously long names in pseudo-Latin.
- Terrified of spiders despite his fascination with giant insects.
- Has a pet wingless pseudodragon named **Finch** that mimics bird calls and holds pens.
- Will sketch mid-conversation if something biological distracts him.

### **Interesting Plot Hooks**

- **Crab**: When the party tries to contact Thaddeus they find that he's been trying the discover the ultimate end to evolution. He meets [[Elenion Virelith]] who the party discover has turned Thaddeus into a crab.

- **The Living Fossil**: Thaddeus hires the party to escort him to a remote isle where he believes a creature unchanged since the Dawn Age dwells. Unfortunately, it’s heavily territorial and worshipped by a tribe of storm-blooded harpies.
  
- **Academic Espionage**: A rival scholar from Mechanica Harbor is trying to steal his notes to publish the theory first—Thaddeus suspects foul play and needs help setting a trap.
  
- **A Beast Unlike Any Other**: The planar rift may have birthed entirely new species—some dangerous, some miraculous. Thaddeus insists the players help him study a strange hybrid creature that seems to adapt its form based on observers’ expectations.

- **Court Pressure**: The Queen Regent wants to use Thaddeus’ discoveries to justify colonization or control of the reshaped isles. Thaddeus is uneasy but relies on her funding—players may need to mediate or choose sides.

- **Mutation Mystery**: Strange evolutionary shifts are happening _too_ quickly on a particular island—entire ecosystems are transforming overnight. Thaddeus believes an artificial force is accelerating evolution… and possibly playing god.
