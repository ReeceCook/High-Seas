# Summary

### Background: 
Lieutenant Commander Alys Baird is a competent naval officer who's earned her position through tactical acumen and leadership rather than political connections. She's been posted to Fort Forseth as a form of quiet punishment after questioning orders during a prior assignment. Though the assignment appears to be a demotion, she's made the best of it, running a tight ship despite limited resources.

## Appearance:
Mid-thirties, with dark hair usually kept in a practical braid. She has weathered skin from years at sea and a small scar cutting through her right eyebrow. Her uniform is impeccable, though slightly outdated in style compared to officers on more prestigious assignments.

## Personality:
Disciplined but pragmatic. She follows protocol religiously in public but is willing to bend rules when necessary. She inspires loyalty in her crew through fair treatment and by sharing hardships rather than delegating them.

## The Debt Collector:
Years ago, Baird fell into debt after paying for expensive medical treatment for her former first mate. To clear her debts, she agreed to work for a powerful merchant who operates in gray areas. She provides protection for certain shipments and receives a percentage that's slowly paying off her obligation.
