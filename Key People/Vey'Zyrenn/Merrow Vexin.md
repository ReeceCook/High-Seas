**Appearance:**  
An older Vey’Zyrenn man with opalescent blue skin and silver-flecked eyes. Always dressed in high-quality naval leathers and fine silk sashes, his fingers are adorned with rings symbolizing various trade pacts. His presence is quiet, but commanding—like deep water just before a storm.

**Personality:**  
Calm, cultured, and unfailingly polite. Vexin speaks in measured tones, even when issuing threats. He believes in reciprocity, though his version of “fair” often benefits him far more than others.

**Background:**  
Once a captain in the Vey’Zyrenn fleet, Vexin left official service decades ago to pursue private enterprise. He rose through the ranks of the Tidebound Circle, eventually earning a seat on its Council of Nine. Known for cutting through bureaucratic knots, he built his empire by handling “sensitive” shipments others wouldn’t touch.

**Motivations:**  
Profit, influence, and plausible deniability. Vexin wants the Tidebound Circle to become the true power in the Isles—free of the Navy’s oversight or the Crown’s meddling. He sees instability as opportunity, and cultivates debts like a banker grows interest.

**Skills and Abilities:**

- Master of logistics and trade law
- Minor water-shaping magic (used to impress or intimidate)
- Fluent in underworld etiquette
- Access to well-paid muscle and subtle saboteurs

**Quirks and Mannerisms:**

- Uses aquatic metaphors in conversation (“The current always favors the prepared,” etc.)
- Always offers drinks, but never accepts one himself
- Carries an enchanted ledger that keeps track of debts—literal and figurative

### **Interesting Plot Hooks:**

- **The Debt Trap:** [[Alys Baird]]'s deal with Vexin can be “bought out”—but only by doing one last favor. Players must choose between helping her repay the debt or breaking her free by exposing Vexin’s criminal dealings.
    
- **Merchant War:** Vexin is in a cold war with another member of the [[The Tidebound Circle]], and he offers the players a chance to tip the scales in his favor.
    
- **Hidden Cargo:** One of Vexin’s protected shipments has gone missing, and he suspects sabotage. If players investigate, they uncover links to the Abyssal Tide—or something worse.
    
- **Double Agent:** If players get close to Vexin, he might try to recruit them, offering money, favors, or even secrets about the Navy’s enemies.![[Pasted image 20250519191333.png]]
