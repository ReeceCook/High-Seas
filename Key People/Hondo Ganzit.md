# Hondo Ganzit - Character Profile

## Concept

Hondo Ganzit is a charismatic, opportunistic smuggler and "businessman" who operates in the gray areas of Azura Isles society. He presents himself as a legitimate merchant while running various questionable enterprises. Despite his criminal tendencies, he has a strong survival instinct and a talent for staying just on the right side of useful to the authorities.

## Background

Once the captain of a respectable Golarion trading vessel, Hondo lost his ship during the planar collision storms. Since then, he's built a patchwork network of questionable contacts across all three factions, operating from whatever vessel he can "temporarily acquire." He claims to have "investments" across the isles, though most are failed schemes or outright fabrications.

## Personality

- Projects exaggerated confidence and grandeur ("Hondo Ganzit, finest purveyor of rare goods in the three planes!")
- Frequently refers to himself in the third person
- Theatrical in speech and gesture, with a flair for dramatic exaggeration
- Surprisingly principled in his own way - has rules he won't break
- Excellent at reading dangerous situations and making timely exits
- Treats betrayal as just "business renegotiation"

## Role in Campaign

Hondo could serve multiple functions:

- **Informant:** Has ears everywhere and sells information about cult activities
- **Occasional Ally:** Helps players when it aligns with his interests
- **Comic Relief:** Provides levity during tense story moments
- **Quest Giver:** Offers "perfectly legitimate business opportunities" that inevitably go sideways
- **Wild Card:** Sometimes helps, sometimes hinders based on profit motive

## Connections

- Has supplied questionable goods to Dockmaster Voss in the past
- Knows the locations of several smuggler hideouts that could connect to cult activity
- Has contacts in all three factions, including some in the Hastellen factories and Vey'Zyrenn coastal settlements
- Maintains a tenuous relationship with Lieutenant Commander Baird, who tolerates him for his useful information

## Notable Traits

- Carries an outdated but modified Hastellen pistol he calls "The Negotiator"
- Wears an elaborate captain's coat with medals he didn't earn
- Has a small Vey'Zyrenn water creature as a "pet" that he claims can detect lies
- Constantly pitches outlandish business ventures to anyone who'll listen

## Sample Dialogue

"Ah, my friends! Hondo is pleased to see you survived that little misunderstanding with the harbor guards. No hard feelings about the, ah, strategic withdrawal I was forced to make, yes? Business is business! Speaking of which, Hondo has come across some very interesting information about certain hooded individuals moving cargo at night. Very mysterious, very profitable... for the right buyer, of course!"

Hondo could first appear during "The Tempest's Bounty" quest, perhaps encountered at The Siren's Rest tavern or trying to "acquire" unclaimed cargo near the warehouses, providing an alternate source of information about the missing crate.
