## Main Courtyard
- Open area just inside the stone wall and wooden palisade
- Provides training space for the limited garrison
- Might include a small well or water collection system   - Perhaps a flagpole with the naval ensign
- Could have a basic shooting range or training dummies

>*You step through the sturdy wooden gate into Fort Forseth's courtyard, a rectangular space enclosed by one imposing stone wall and three sides of wooden palisade. The packed dirt ground shows signs of regular raking, with not a single weed to be found. A modest flagpole stands in the center, the naval colors hanging limply in the still air. To one side, straw training dummies stand in perfect formation, barely weathered from use. The occasional call of a bored sentry echoes across the open space, and you can hear the rhythmic sound of a broom sweeping already clean stone steps. Despite the fort's military purpose, there's a striking absence of bustle or activity—just two young recruits polishing a small stack of cannonballs that look like they've never seen combat.*

## Barracks Building
- The main structure within the fort
- Long hall with rows of mostly empty beds
- Personal footlockers for the few stationed soldiers
- Common area with tables for meals and recreation
- Exceptionally clean due to bored soldiers having little else to do

>*The barracks is a long, single-story wooden structure with a shingled roof and windows set at regular intervals. As you enter, you're struck by the almost unnatural cleanliness—the wooden floor has been scrubbed and polished to a soft gleam, and the air carries the sharp scent of pine soap. Two neat rows of beds line the walls, their blankets folded with precise corners, though only five or six show signs of current occupation. Personal effects are minimal and meticulously organized on small shelves above each occupied bed. At the far end, several soldiers sit at a long table playing cards with hushed voices, as if louder conversation might disturb the oppressive tidiness. A roster on the wall shows guard rotations with hours precisely marked, yet many slots remain empty.*

## Officers' Quarters
- Small wing or section at one end of the barracks
- Two or three private rooms, though only one currently occupied
- Commander's office with desk, maps of the region, and communication equipment
- Perhaps a small meeting room where orders are issued
- More comfortable furnishings than the regular barracks

>*The officers' quarters occupy the eastern wing of the fort, marked by a door bearing a simple brass insignia. Inside, a narrow hallway leads to three rooms, though only one shows signs of use. The occupied office belongs to Lieutenant Commander Baird, a meticulously organized space with a polished desk centered beneath a window overlooking the harbor. Naval charts of the surrounding waters are pinned to one wall with navigational instruments hanging nearby, while a cabinet displays a collection of logbooks dating back years, their spines all aligned at perfect angles. The room smells of ink, parchment, and leather polish. A small cot in the corner is made with military precision. On the desk sits a half-written report and a cold cup of tea, the only evidence that the otherwise pristine room is actively used.*

## Storeroom
- Secure area for weapons, ammunition, and supplies
- Carefully inventoried (perhaps overly so, as the quartermaster has little else to do)
- Food stores and emergency rations
- Spare uniforms, boots, and equipment
- Maybe a small armory section with better-quality weapons kept under lock

>*The fort's storeroom is a secure chamber with iron-banded door and heavy lock, containing neatly inventoried supplies, weapons racks with more empty spaces than filled ones, and barrels of preserved rations stacked according to expiration date.*
## Guard Towers
- Two stone towers at corners of the completed stone wall
- Lookout positions with views of the surrounding waters
- Simple communication system (bells or flags) to signal ships
- Small braziers for signal fires if needed
- Shelter from weather for guards on duty

>*The two stone guard towers rise from opposite corners of the completed wall, each featuring a simple wooden platform, a small bench, and a covered brazier for signal fires, with views spanning the surrounding waters and approaching paths to the island.*
