# Background

St. Forseth is the sit of a partially built naval fort. A fairly small island with a few houses a single tavern and a limited garrison in it's Fort. 
## Vibes

This place is underdeveloped and often forgotten about. It was half built when the military thought they would need a larger military presence here but ultimately has been left fairly alone after that.
## Locations

### Fort Forseth

A single stone wall with two small towers dominates the fort with the remaining walls left as a wooden palisade.
The building itself is most a barracks with a a couple of racks of beds. Although the vast majority are empty. 
At one end there a couple of small offices although only one is occupied.
The fort is immaculately kept with a couple of grunts seen sweeping an already clean floor. There's clearly not a huge amount to be doing.

### Red Lobster
St Forseth's Tavern sits on the waterfront protected from the sea by a mostly finished stone quay. There's a number of chairs outside with a limited amount of seating inside and a bar. 
Drinks selection is poor and is whatever is brought in on the limited supply runs from either the garrison or traders.
The barkeep does have a secret special moonshine batch on the go which he shares with a couple of his friends on the island.
There's a single room for guests, that's seldom used and not made up but would theoretically sleep 4 on a couple of bunk beds.

>*The Red Lobster stands as a weathered two-story building with faded red paint peeling from its wooden exterior. As you approach, the rhythmic sound of waves lapping against the stone quay mingles with occasional bursts of laughter from inside. Pushing open the salt-worn door, you're greeted by the rich aroma of fish stew and strong ale. The tavern's interior is modest but cozy—mismatched tables and chairs scattered across a floor smoothed by years of boot traffic. Behind a polished driftwood bar, a burly man with a braided beard wipes tankards while eyeing newcomers. A few locals occupy the corner tables, their weathered faces turning briefly to assess you before returning to their drinks and hushed conversations. Through an open window, the briny sea breeze carries in the distant call of gulls circling the harbor.*

### The Trading Post and dry goods store.
- Two-story wooden structure with a wide porch facing the harbor
- First floor contains the island's only general store, selling basic necessities, fishing equipment, and occasionally weapons or armor when available
- Run by Hollus Waycrest, a shrewd half-elf merchant with more connection than he lets on.
- Back room serves as Hollus's office and contains a small collection of oddities gathered from travelers
- Second floor divided into:
	- Small postal station where messages wait for delivery ships
	- Storage area for unsold merchandise and seasonal items
	- Alongside Hollus's Living Quarters

>*The island's Trading Post dominates the small harbor front—a sturdy two-story wooden structure with a wide covered porch where crates and barrels await transport. Wind-worn flags from various trading companies flutter from poles along the roofline. As you enter, the floorboards creak beneath your feet, and your senses are immediately overwhelmed by a curious blend of smells: leather, spices, lamp oil, and the unmistakable musty scent of stored fabrics. The walls are lined with shelves containing everything from fishing hooks to cooking pots, while ropes, lanterns, and dried herbs hang from the ceiling beams. Behind the long counter, Hollus Waycrest, a keen-eyed half-elf, tallies figures in a ledger while simultaneously negotiating with a sailor over the price of navigational charts. A notice board near the door is covered with weathered parchments—wanted posters, shipping schedules, and job opportunities competing for space.*

### The Twins' Cottage
- Humble but well-maintained dwelling with unusual twin chimneys
- Home to identical twin sisters Marta and Mira, elderly women who arrived decades ago
- Front room serves as an unofficial apothecary/healer's station
- Strange charms and trinkets hang from the rafters
- Locals whisper that the twins can predict storms and illnesses before they arrive

>*The Twins' Cottage stands apart from other buildings, its stone walls covered in climbing vines with small purple flowers. Twin chimneys rise from the thatched roof, sweet-smelling smoke curling skyward. Unusual plants surround the home with stone paths winding between herb beds. Wind chimes of shells, bones, and colored glass create a delicate melody as you approach. Inside, the air is thick with the scent of drying herbs and something faintly spicy. Plant bundles hang from the rafters, while shelves are filled with labeled jars and bottles. In opposite corners sit two identical rocking chairs, where Marta and Mira—elderly women with silver hair and knowing eyes—greet you in unsettling unison, somehow anticipating your arrival before you've knocked.*
### The Quartermaster's House
- Slightly larger than the other dwellings, positioned between the fort and the harbor
- Occupied by Quartermaster Vane and his wife Eliza
- Contains a locked chest with official naval documents
- A small garden out back where Eliza grows medicinal herbs unavailable on the regular supply ships

>*The Quartermaster's house sits strategically between harbor and fort—a well-maintained structure of stone and timber that speaks of naval precision. A small, orderly garden borders the path to the front door with its polished brass naval insignia knocker. Inside, the front room maintains austere organization with neatly rolled charts and precisely stacked ledgers, while the scent of beeswax polish and fresh bread fills the air. Through a back window, you can see Quartermaster Vane inspecting crates in the attached storehouse, while his wife Eliza moves between kitchen and garden, humming a melody that seems vaguely familiar yet impossible to place.*

### The Fisherman's Hut
- Simple one-story wooden structure close to the water with nets hanging outside to dry
- Home to Jormund, a grizzled human fisherman in his 50s who knows every fishing spot around the island
- Small dock extending from the property with his weathered fishing boat tied up
- Smoke house attached to the side where he preserves his catch
- Often trades fresh fish with other islanders for goods and services

>*Jormund's fishing hut squats close to the waterline, its wooden walls silvered by years of salt spray. Fishing nets spread across frames to dry, dotted with seaweed and shells. The air smells of salt, fish, and woodsmoke from the small smokehouse where blue tendrils escape through roof cracks. A weathered dock extends into calm waters where Jormund's oft-repaired boat rocks gently. Through the open door, you see Jormund seated on a stool, his gnarled hands repairing a torn net, pipe clenched between his teeth. Fish in various stages of drying hang along the outer walls, their scales catching the light when the breeze makes them sway.*

### The Crabber's Home
- Slightly ramshackle structure built partially on stilts at the edge of a small cove
- Residence of Tully and his adult son Dorn, who specialize in crab and lobster traps
- Multiple crab pots and traps visible around the property
- A small workshop where they craft and repair their trapping gear
- Their home has a distinctive smell of brine and seafood
- They supply the Red Lobster tavern with its namesake catch when in season

>This home balances on thick wooden stilts at the edge of the beach accessible by worn steps that creak with each footfall. The air smells strongly of brine, boiled shellfish, and tar. Stacks of wooden crab pots and lobster traps surround the structure, many in various states of repair. Beneath the house, a few escaped crabs occasionally scuttle before being recaptured by a young man. From the attached workshop, you hear metallic clinks as Tully works copper wire into new traps. Colorful ropes, buoys, and markers hang from every surface against the weathered gray wood. The unmistakable aroma of crab stew wafts from the chimney.
