**Gravesend Atoll** is a **new island**, one that emerged after the planar collision.  
It appears as a **jagged crescent of black rock and withered jungle**, choked by a constant mist.  
At its heart lies the **Sunken Sanctum**, an ancient crypt pulled into this plane during the collision — now ruled by a rogue necromancer named **Vandros Mournspire**.

> Vandros was once a Hastellen scholar studying planar energy, corrupted when the planar rift flooded his mind with visions of death's dominions.

# ✦ Hook Options

Choose how you introduce it:

- **Seamen Rumors** A lost navy ship’s reported seeing Ghosts near the islands
- **Missing Scouts:** A survey team (sent to chart the new islands) vanished after their last report mentioned "a crypt emerging from the rocks."
- **Magical Anomaly:** A surge of necrotic energy (maybe disrupting Hastellen planar devices) points toward this uncharted island.

# Mechanic
Esclating Doom condition. The closer the players get to the forbidden sanctum they get escalating doom levels.

### **Shattered Shoreline**

> A jagged, reef-strewn coast filled with wrecked ships and half-buried corpses. The water smells of rot, and strange lights flicker beneath the waves.

- **Encounter:**
    
    - _Drowned Sailors_ rise from the surf. Some still wear uniforms from the Golarion or Hastellen navy — but speak cryptic half-thoughts.
    - They try to drag players into the water and mutter about "The Pale King’s command."
        
- **Clue Options:**
    
    - A ship’s log that mentions “a storm that came from nowhere” and a “man with white eyes” walking on water.
    - A half-sunken crate of **Hastellen equipment** marked as property of a planar research team.
        
- **Skill-Based Alternatives:**
    
    - _Survival or Nature:_ Track the undead’s origin — their footprints lead inland, unnaturally preserved.
    - _Religion or Arcana:_ Identify the nature of the undead — something is sustaining them beyond necromancy alone.

### 2. **Withered Jungle**

> The flora is twisted — vines like veins, trees bleeding dark sap. The jungle hums with wrongness, like it's holding its breath.

- **Encounter:**
    
    - _Bonecoil Vines_ (hazard/creature hybrid) lash out at movement. Inside one tree, a corpse dangles with a pendant engraved with Vandros’ sigil.
    - _Optional Sub-Encounter:_ A dying **Vey'Zyrenn scout** (half-turned to shadow) begs the players to stop “the one opening the wound.”
        
- **Clue Options:**
    
    - A torn journal entry: _“He calls it a ‘sanctum,’ but it’s a tomb... a wound upon this world.”_
    - A carved map showing the jungle trail with a portion circled and labeled _“Heart of Decay.”_
        
- **Skill-Based Alternatives:**
    
    - _Nature or Arcana:_ Determine the jungle is being partially phased with another plane — likely
    - _Heal:_ Stabilize the scout and learn more about Vandros’s ritual.

### 3. **The Whispering Graves**

> Atop a hill of black earth, dozens of shallow graves emit soft whispers. The air is colder here. Each grave holds one lost soul — and their memories.

- **Encounter:**
    
    - _Spiritual Puzzle or Combat:_ The spirits are restless, and one manifests as a _Gravewraith_ that must be calmed or defeated.
    - If the players interact with the graves respectfully (using **Speak with Dead, Religion, or Insight**), they can gather vital backstory.
        
- **Clue Options:**
    
    - The spirits speak of a man who _“stole death’s power”_ and dragged them here with a shard of the veil.
    - One ghost saw Vandros’ sanctum: _“A stone mouth in the jungle, breathing shadow.”_
        
- **Skill-Based Alternatives:**
    
    - _Religion or Occultism:_ Banish or soothe the spirits.
    - _Perform or Diplomacy:_ Appease the spirits and gain their trust.
