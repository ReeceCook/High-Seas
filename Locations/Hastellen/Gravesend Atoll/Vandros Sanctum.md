### 🛏️ **Main Bedroom + Attached Office**

**Purpose:** Vandros’s personal quarters, half-preserved and half-consumed by shadow. This is the emotional heart of the sanctum.

- **Description:**
    
    - Rich but decayed furnishings warped by planar energy.
        
    - A cracked mirror reflects a _different_ version of the room — pristine, full of light.
        
    - Floating books circle a desk that pulses with necrotic runes.
        
- **Mechanics:**
    
    - The **mirror** shows a time before Vandros’s corruption — interacting with it (Arcana or Will save) causes a psychic flashback.
        
    - The **desk** contains Vandros’s early journals, revealing:
        
        - His Hastellen affiliation.
            
        - His obsession with _“eternity through planar convergence.”_
            
        - A formula or sigil sketch matching one seen in the Whispering Graves or the jungle.
            
- **Challenge/Reward:**
    
    - Mirror can act as a **scrying focus** — allow 1 player to get a glimpse of Vandros’s current plan or reinforcements arriving elsewhere.
        
    - DC 18 Arcana reveals a hidden **command word** to deactivate the final portal defense.

### 🛏️ **Guest Bedroom**

**Purpose:** Previously for colleagues or planar scholars. Now desecrated — contains echoes of betrayal.

- **Description:**
    
    - One bed is untouched, the other shredded by claw marks.
        
    - A twisted Hastellen automaton, now shadow-infused, paces inside muttering in broken dwarven.
        
- **Mechanics:**
    
    - **Combat:** The automaton becomes hostile if threatened, or if players disturb the area without using calming words from Vandros’s journals.
        
    - **Puzzle/Roleplay:** The automaton can be reasoned with using _Hastellen command phrases_, giving insights into early rift experiments and that Vandros _exiled or sacrificed_ his research team.
        
- **Challenge/Reward:**
    
    - Hidden under the intact bed is a **fractured planar compass** (minor magical item that grants +2 to navigating planar anomalies).
        
    - If players helped the dying Vey’Zyrenn scout earlier, they can recognize the other bed belonged to _her brother_.

### 🌫️ **Outside Area (Collapsed Courtyard / Cliffside View)**

**Purpose:** Gives players a sense of the island’s instability and the larger threat.

- **Description:**
    
    - Wind howls through broken stone arches. From here, players can see the **rift forming** in the sky — a glowing scar leaking shadowstuff.
        
    - The ground trembles every few minutes, and ghostly birds scream overhead.
        
- **Mechanics:**
    
    - A **planar instability hazard** pulses every 3 rounds, forcing a Reflex or Fort save or take force/shadow damage.
        
    - Optional **short combat encounter**: a _Shadow Manticore_ flies in from the rift, drawn to the portal's energy.
        
- **Clue Tie-In:**
    
    - The spirits in the Whispering Graves spoke of the sky “ripping open” — players now see it literally.
        
    - Characters can deduce that if the **ritual finishes**, this island may become a permanent gateway to the Shadow Plane.
        
- **Challenge/Reward:**
    
    - Players can attempt to **disable or weaken** the rift’s pull (e.g., Arcana or using the fractured compass from the guest room).

### 📦 **Storage Area and Workshop**

**Purpose:** Vandros’s experimental lab and staging ground for his ritual.

- **Description:**
    
    - Cages full of dead and living experiments (some pleading for death).
        
    - Crates stamped with the **Hastellen sigil** contain magical reagents and broken automaton parts.
        
    - A partially-disassembled **construct** that resembles the Gravetide Guardian.
        
- **Mechanics:**
    
    - **Hazard or Puzzle:** Touching the wrong component (or rushing the room) triggers a trap — shadowfire glyphs explode unless disarmed (Thievery or Arcana).
        
    - **Lore Find:** A chalkboard reveals the “balance equation” of death and shadow Vandros used — flawed, and potentially the key to disrupting the main portal.
        
- **Challenge/Reward:**
    
    - Recover **shadowforged components** — useful for crafting or bribing the Hastellen.
        
    - Clue to a **"planar dampening frequency"** — a code that can weaken the final portal’s defense if used during the final fight.

### 🧪 **Crafting Area (Dark Alchemical Lab)**

**Purpose:** Where Vandros created hybrid creatures and fine-tuned the ritual spell.

- **Description:**
    
    - A massive vat filled with black ichor, bones, and dissolved metal.
        
    - Chains dangle from the ceiling, some still twitching.
        
    - An animated skeleton, shackled to the wall, gibbers ancient prayers.
        
- **Mechanics:**
    
    - **Interactive Puzzle or Roleplay:** The shackled skeleton is an ancient planar priest — driven mad but still wise. If calmed, he reveals the final step in Vandros’s ritual requires _three souls tied to the island_ (explaining missing NPCs).
        
    - **Skill Challenge:** Investigating the lab (Arcana, Occultism) allows players to create **anti-shadow salves** or **ritual counteragents** for the final room.
        
- **Challenge/Reward:**
    
    - 1–2 **single-use ritual reagents** — let the players cancel a phase of Vandros’s spells or disable one summoned minion.
        
    - Optional **mutagenic hazard** — touching raw materials can cause temporary mutations (+1 STR but -2 WIS, etc.).

### 🌀 **Main Portal Chamber**

**Purpose:** The final arena — a half-complete planar gate opening into the Shadow Plane.

- **Description:**
    
    - A massive stone ring inscribed with glowing sigils.
        
    - Vandros stands at the center, arms raised, shadows spiraling from his fingertips.
        
    - Soul cages crackle with energy — maybe even one containing a captured NPC or ally.
        
- **Mechanics:**
    
    - **Multi-Phase Boss Fight:**
        
        1. **Ritual Phase:** Vandros is protected by planar shields. The players must disrupt soul cages or use discovered clues (e.g., command words or dampening frequency).
            
        2. **Combat Phase:** Once vulnerable, he summons shadow doubles or fuses with a creature from the other side.
            
        3. **Collapse Phase (if things go south):** Players must escape as the portal begins tearing the room apart — think skill challenge meets final escape.
            
- **Optional Twist:**
    
    - One of the NPC souls offers to _merge with a PC temporarily_ to give them powers or insights — but risks corruption.
