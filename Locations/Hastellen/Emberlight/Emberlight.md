## **Hastellen Mining Colony – Mission Hook and Setup**

### 🎯 **Why the Players Are Sent:**

**Mission Name:** _Operation Emberlight_

**Objective:**  
Investigate a **communications blackout** at an automated Hastellen mining station, **Station KX-17**, which was extracting **deep-vein Manavine** in a newly discovered stratum post-planar collision.

The Golarion Navy has a tenuous alliance with the Hastellen (or maybe a strained one), so they're asked to send a **neutral party** (the players) to check on the site. Officially, it’s just a “systems malfunction.” Unofficially, the last message from the station included the phrase: **“We dug too deep.”**

### 🛢️ **The Mining Colony:**

- Built into a cliffside crater or canyon wall, full of brass scaffolding, steam lifts, drill rigs, conveyor belts, and rail lines.
    
- Has a rail transport network for shipping Manavine ore to other Hastellen outposts.
    
- Mostly automated: arcano-mechanical drones, overseer constructs, and a small skeleton crew of engineers.

### 🔥 **What Went Wrong:**

#### Option A – **Planar Breach Below**

They struck a **planar fault line**—a pressure point left behind by the rift event. Tapping into it released a surge of extraplanar energy that either:

- **Warped the automatons** (they go rogue—think arcane Skynet), or
    
- **Opened a rift** to a hostile minor plane (Shadow, Earth, or a custom realm), allowing entities to seep in.
    

#### Option B – **Manavine Overexposure**

The deep-vein Manavine is unstable. After over-mining, the **ore itself became semi-sentient** and began lashing out through magnetic pulses, driving machines and some workers mad (like a magical version of "The Thing").

#### Option C – **Sabotage**

A faction (e.g., the Abyssal Tide or rogue Hastellen separatists) infiltrated the colony and planted a **Manavine corruption seed** to trigger the meltdown.

### 🧨 **The Adventure Flow:**

#### **1. Arrival**

- Players land at the quiet, fog-shrouded station.
    
- Signs of struggle: lights flickering, scorch marks, bloodless bodies.
    
- Machines appear dormant—or cooperative at first.
    

#### **2. Investigation**

- Players access control centers or mining logs, learning the dig went further than authorized.
    
- They hear distant mechanical thuds… then alarms sound.
    
- A **“purge” protocol** activates, or entities start attacking.
    

#### **3. Hold the Line**

- Players are cut off and must **hold a loading bay or control room**.
    
- Waves of enemies attack: warped automatons, corrupted Hastellen constructs, or planar invaders.
    
- Optional: rescue a surviving engineer who knows the escape plan.
    

#### **4. The Train Escape**

- The only way out is a **cargo transport railcar**.
    
- Players race through catwalks and cranes to reach the rail hub.
    
- Final wave of enemies chases them as they board the train.
    
- Train departs amid explosions or collapsing scaffolding.
    

> Optional: The escape train is sabotaged or chased along the rails by flying drones, burrowers, or even another train!

### 🎁 **Bonus Threads to Seed:**

- A stolen **data crystal** contains readings on the Manavine fault—valuable and dangerous.
    
- The train route passes through or near another unstable zone (new island? ghost station?).
    
- A **fragment of planar material** fuses with a player or NPC.
    
- The players are blamed for the failure upon return—political fallout.
