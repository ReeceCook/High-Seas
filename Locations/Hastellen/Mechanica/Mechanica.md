*Mechanica is a city of brass and steam built in tiered levels up the cliffside, with steam lifts, conveyor ramps, and suspended cable cars connecting different sections. Pipes hiss and gears click constantly as automatons patrol the streets or assist in construction, industry, and civic work. Despite the constant clatter, there’s an orderliness to the chaos.*

### Municipal Authority District (Upper Level)

**Use for: Political interactions, intrigue, noble-focused quests**

- **Municipal Authority Building:** Where the party meets Chancellor Cogsworth. Includes administrative offices, the Council Chamber (where the Guildmasters and Engineers convene), and the Chancellor’s residence.
- **The Gilded Gear Archives:** A vast library and vault of technical blueprints, magical-tech research, and historical treaties. Guards and knowledge keepers are strict, but knowledge is power here.
- **The Spiraled Assembly Hall:** A domed debating chamber where engineers present innovations to win government funding or guild recognition. Could be a site for social/political events.
    
**Future Hook:** A rival inventor petitions for research funding that Emberlynn and Varashiel would have otherwise received—leading to sabotage, espionage, or theft.

### Cogsreach Industrial Zone (Mid-Level)

**Use for: Invention, crafting, social unrest, criminal underbelly**

- **The Crucible Works:** A sprawling forge and refinery complex for Manavine processing. High security. Sparks fly constantly from blast furnaces and foundries.
- **Automata Assembly Hall Nine:** Where new automatons are constructed. Players might assist with a runaway unit or be invited to observe (or sabotage?) a demonstration.
- **Scrapwell Tinker’s Lane:** A narrow alley of small workshops, hobbyist garages, and unauthorized inventors. Young rebels and “Free Gears” sympathizers hang out here.
- **The Smoggryphon:** A dingy speakeasy hidden in a ventilation shaft behind a gear press. Known to be a neutral meeting ground for smugglers, rebels, and off-duty guards.
    
**Future Hook:** A “Free Gears” member gives the party a prototype tech-magic hybrid device to smuggle out—or test under pressure.

### Steamjet Docks (Lower Level)

**Use for: Exploration prep, trade, shady dealings**

- **Docking Platform Aether-4:** For experimental ships and vessels not cleared for public routes. Varashiel and Emberlynn’s prototype submersible may have departed from here.
- **The Dockmaster's Rotunda:** Oversees arrivals and departures. Bureaucratic nightmare. Dockmaster Elsin Ratch is grumpy, hyper-efficient, and secretly a collector of Golarion cigars.
- **The Chugging Leviathan:** A tavern built into a refitted ironclad ship. A great place for overhearing rumors and striking deals with strange travelers.
- **The Rusted Reef Market:** Open-air stalls run by non-guild artisans and travelers. Illegal or “unofficial” trade flourishes here—everything from Vey’Zyrenn alchemy to salvaged plane-touched materials.
    
**Future Hook:** A mysterious sailor offers Manavine-infused crystals with strange planar properties—but warns they were “not of this world.”

### The Enlightened Spire (Academic/Research District)

**Use for: Magical-tech interactions, research, high-level intrigue**

- **Institute of Energetic Mechanics:** A prestigious research center. The party could find allies or critics of Emberlynn’s theories here.
- **Chronocrypt Vaults:** An experimental research lab specializing in time-bending effects. Access restricted. Might house clues to the planar rift.
- **The Spiral Observatory:** A rotating lens-tower used to track celestial events and planar phenomena. The operator, Professor Zeffrel Vink, is an eccentric seer-engineer.
    
**Future Hook:** A visiting Vey’Zyrenn scholar (not Varashiel) suspects the observatory is hiding data about the magical storms that reshaped the isles.

### Gearbound Garrison (Military Quarter)

**Use for: Security, faction missions, infiltration, faction tension**

- **Steelwright Barracks:** Home of Captain Brunhilde’s elite security force. Could become an enemy HQ or an uneasy ally’s base.
- **The Iron Parade Ground:** A massive drill square where mechanized suits and clockwork cavalry are tested. Maybe a fun distraction or trial-by-combat location.
- **Vault K7:** A subterranean weapons testing facility. Possibly holds dangerous experimental tech—players might need to break in or rescue someone from here.

**Future Hook:** A vault explosion leads to a lockdown, and the party is the only group with knowledge of how to get in or stop the threat.
