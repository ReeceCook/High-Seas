>You step into a cavernous workshop alive with the rhythmic clatter of gears and the hiss of steam. Long assembly lines stretch from wall to wall, where half-finished humanoid automatons hang from suspending rigs—torsos clicking into place, limbs being socketed with practiced precision by rotating arms and dwarf engineers in brass goggles.

>Each automaton is human-sized, sleek and utilitarian, etched with runes along reinforced joints. Some have faces shaped in mock expressions—others wear blank steel visors, awaiting their first activation. Sparks leap as welders fix delicate components, and occasionally, a newly powered unit jerks to life and is guided forward for inspection.

>Overseeing it all is a control gantry suspended above the factory floor, issuing commands via a glowing console of dials and levers.
