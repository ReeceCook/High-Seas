>Pushing open the heavy oak door, you're hit by a wave of warmth, noise, and the rich aroma of spiced rum and hearty stew. The massive room is constructed of curved ship timbers that arch overhead like ribs of some great beast. Sailors crowd around scarred wooden tables, their voices competing with a one-legged fiddler in the corner. Porthole windows cast circular pools of light on the floor, while a burly server weaves between patrons with a tray of luminous blue drinks that seem to shimmer with an inner light. From the upper floors, you hear the clatter of dice and muffled negotiations.
