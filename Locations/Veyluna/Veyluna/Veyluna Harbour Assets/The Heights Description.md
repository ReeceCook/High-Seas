>Clean, cobbled streets run in orderly lines between well-maintained buildings of stone and timber. Gardens peek over courtyard walls, offering glimpses of colorful flowers and small fountains whose gentle splashing provides a peaceful counterpoint to distant harbor noises. The air here smells of garden herbs and wood smoke from well-kept chimneys. A pair of Veyluna Guards in polished armor nod respectfully as they pass on patrol. From an open second-story window, you hear the practiced scales of someone learning to play a stringed instrument, the melancholy notes floating on the breeze.
