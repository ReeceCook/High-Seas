>Narrow streets twist between buildings of odd angles and mismatched heights, creating patches of deep shadow even at midday. Laundry hangs between upper windows, creating a colorful canopy above your heads. Children dart between alleyways playing some game with rules only they understand, while the smell of fish stew and baking bread wafts from open windows. A street vendor argues loudly with a customer over the price of rope, gesturing wildly. You notice subtle markings near certain doorwaysâ€”signs that might be meaningless to outsiders but clearly communicate something to those who know how to read them.
