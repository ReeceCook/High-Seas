>You step into an open cobblestone plaza alive with color and commerce. Merchants call out their wares from beneath striped canvas awnings that snap in the sea breeze. Barrels of fresh fish sit packed in crushed ice, while nearby a Vey'Zyrenn trader in iridescent robes hovers over a tank of strange, glowing aquatic creatures. The air is fragrant with fresh bread from a nearby stall and exotic spices you can't identify. From a raised platform at the center, a harbor crier rings a brass bell and announces the arrival of a ship from distant shores, his voice carrying over the haggling crowds.
