>A wooden wall topped with iron spikes separates these warehouses from the rest of the harbor. Blue and silver uniformed guards stand alert at the single visible entrance, their posture professional but tense. Beyond them, you glimpse sturdy warehouses with reinforced doors and unusually small windows. No sounds of normal warehouse activity reach your ears—no shouting, no crates being moved—only an occasional metallic clang followed by silence. A whiff of something strange—like ozone after a lightning strike—drifts over the wall, mingling with the normal harbor smells.
