>The heavy iron door of Warehouse 6 slides open with a metallic screech. Inside, rows of shelves stretch into shadow, laden with gleaming Hastellen components and crates of polished metals. Brass fittings catch the light from high windows, and the air smells of oil and metal polish. A constant, rhythmic tapping comes from the back of the warehouse, where a dwarf in leather apron methodically tests gears against a template. Steam hisses from a pressure valve somewhere in the darkness, momentarily obscuring your vision with a warm fog.
