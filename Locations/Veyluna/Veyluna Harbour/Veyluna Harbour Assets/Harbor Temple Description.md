>Blue-tiled domes catch the sunlight as you approach the stone temple. Inside, the air is cool and still, scented with incense and seawater from ceremonial basins. Colored light filters through stained glass windows depicting ocean scenes, dancing across stone floors worn smooth by years of devotion. A priest in blue and green robes quietly counsels a nervous-looking sailor in one alcove. From somewhere overhead, the temple bell rings three timesâ€”not for the hour, but in what the locals recognize as a blessing for a departing ship. Near a side wall, you notice priests huddled around a strange device that occasionally emits a soft blue pulse.
