>The interior of the square building is surprisingly orderly, with polished wooden counters dividing the space. Maps of the harbor hang on whitewashed walls, each pin and notation meticulously placed. The scent of ink and parchment hangs in the air, occasionally disrupted by salt breeze through the open windows. The clicking of an abacus provides a steady rhythm as dock fees are calculated. Behind one counter, a small Hastellen automaton—no taller than a halfling—processes documents with mechanical precision, its bronze fingers stamping papers with uncanny speed while harried clerks dart between desks with scrolls and ledgers.
