Players are given a hook to take them to an island.

This could be the first time they meet an ancient civilization that used manavine. They come across some sort of lab. 

Inside is a whole bunch of vats which are cracks and broken. The players make their way down and find a control panel written in a strange language.

Something triggers and they get pulled into a portal. They're in the same lab but in a paraell dimenion. This is made obvious by the fact that there appears to have been a massive fight here. With blood everywhere.

Some massive monster is going to approach while the players have to refill the vats in order to retrigger the portal and get home.
