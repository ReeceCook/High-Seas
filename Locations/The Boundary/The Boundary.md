## The Boundary - Location Details

### Harbour Area/Dock

- A small half-moon shaped inlet with both traditional wooden piers (Golarion style) and brass-reinforced docking platforms (Hastellen design)
- Several unusual vessels moored here:
    - A small Hastellen steam-powered skiff with mechanical crane attachments
    - A Vey'Zyrenn boat that seems partially alive, its hull made of treated wood that subtly ripples like breathing
- The dock features a peculiar loading system: one side uses Hastellen mechanical pulleys and gears, while the other uses Vey'Zyrenn enchanted water currents that help float cargo to shore
- A small harbormaster's station contains navigation charts showing safe passages that account for both physical hazards and planar anomalies
- Curious hybrid barnacles grow on the underside of the docks, glowing faintly at night and occasionally emitting tiny sparks

### Lower Gardens

- Primarily Hastellen in design with:
    - Geometric plant beds arranged in precise mathematical patterns
    - Small copper automatons tending to plants on scheduled rotations
    - Steam-powered irrigation systems that create a constant ambient hiss
    - Vegetation organized by practical purpose: medicinal herbs, edible plants, and experimental hybrids
- Several workbenches where Emberlynn conducts plant hybridization experiments
- A glass greenhouse with brass framing containing plants that respond to mechanical stimuli
- Hidden pressure plates that activate recorded messages from Emberlynn explaining her research to visitors

### Upper Gardens/Courtyard

- The transition zone where the two styles most visibly merge:
    - Hastellen mechanical fountains whose water flows in impossible patterns due to Vey'Zyrenn enchantments
    - A sundial whose shadow moves according to planar time rather than local time
    - Benches made of living wood strengthened with bronze reinforcements
    - Manavine-infused flowering plants that change color based on nearby emotional states
- A central meeting area with a table and chairs designed for diplomatic discussions
- Several planar measurement devices disguised as garden ornaments
- A meditation circle where the couple practices combining their respective magical and technical disciplines

### Rear Gardens

- Predominantly Vey'Zyrenn in design with:
    - Plants growing in seemingly impossible configurations, some floating slightly above the ground
    - Small water features that flow upward rather than downward
    - Luminescent algae pools that respond to sound by changing colors
    - Weather in this section sometimes differs from the rest of the island due to localized magical influence
- A ceremonial space where Varashiel performs Vey'Zyrenn rituals to commune with ocean energies
- Several experimental areas where planar energies are being channeled into controlled environments
- A hidden observation blind for monitoring sea creatures affected by the planar collision

### The Main Structure (Temple-like Building)

- Exterior architecture that impossibly combines styles:
    - One half features Hastellen brass domes, gears, and symmetrical precision
    - One half showcases Vey'Zyrenn flowing organic forms and materials that seem to shift subtly
    - The joining line between the two styles creates a visible "seam" that occasionally sparkles with planar energy
- Interior spaces include:
    - **Entry Hall**: Displays documenting the couple's research journey and growing relationship
    - **West Wing (Emberlynn's Laboratory)**: Filled with Hastellen scientific equipment, drafting tables with mechanical designs, and partially assembled automatons modified to detect planar fluctuations
    - **East Wing (Varashiel's Study)**: Contains magical artifacts, enchanted pools for scrying, and bookshelves with floating tomes on planar theory
    - **Central Chamber**: The heart of their research where a massive Manavine crystal is suspended in a containment field that uses both technology and magic
    - **Upper Level**: Living quarters showing the blend of their personal lives, with personal items from both cultures
    - **Secret Basement**: Accessible via a mechanism requiring both mechanical keys and magical gestures, containing their most sensitive research findings and evidence of deliberate planar sabotage

## Distinctive Features Throughout

- Everywhere in the compound, small Manavine crystals serve as power sources for both magical and technological devices
- At random intervals, minor planar fluctuations cause brief phenomena: objects momentarily floating, echoes of conversations not yet had, or glimpses of the same location in another plane
- The entire island experiences a daily phenomenon at sunset where the boundary between planes thins, causing the sky to show glimpses of another world's stars
- Communication devices that combine speaking tubes with magical telepathic amplifiers allow conversation throughout the compound
