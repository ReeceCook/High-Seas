### 📜 Local Rumor

> “The beast’s eyes are like lanterns in the fog, and it hoots like thunder. Took a goat whole, it did!”

Locals blame an _owlbear_, a creature few have seen but many fear. They’ve cobbled together a sketch based on rumors (see sidebar image). However, this picture was drawn by a local teen and labeled in the Bristlenest dialect:

> _“Drawn from second-hand talkin’s. Mayhap not exact.”_

### 🧭 Adventure Hooks

- **Bait & Switch**: PCs are shown the wrong drawing. The beast doesn’t match. Clues (tracks, feather patterns, cave droppings) point to the truth. Clever PCs can piece it together before confrontation.
    
- **Nest Trouble**: A collapsed sea cave blocked its normal food route, pushing it inland.
    
- **Ecological Link**: Strange magic near the rookery (a corrupted Manavine crystal?) caused its mutation.
