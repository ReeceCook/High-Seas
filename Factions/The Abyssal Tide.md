### 2. **Faction Summary**

The Abyssal Tide is a secretive, loosely-organized cult that believes the recent planar disturbances are signs of an approaching cataclysm—or opportunity. They revere an enigmatic entity known only as **The Voice of the Deep**, who communicates through Manavine crystals. The cult acts to intercept and “redirect” key materials they believe are tied to this planar convergence.

The key here is that the Abyssal tide is only listening to the voice of the deep, they were formed after hearing this. They don't actually have influence or have caused anything about the collision.
