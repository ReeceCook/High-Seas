# Summary
The Golarions settled the Azura Isles from the east where they live on a couple of large continents. The Saga Lands and Old Cheliax.

They rely on manpower and large sailing ships. They have a good selection of wizards and mages but they aren't fully integrated into the common man.

# Faction Leadership

The Queen Regent is responsible for the day to day management of the Azura Isles.

She appoints 4 stewards of representing the major islands and island chains.

## The Queen Regent

**Queen Regent Lysara Veymont** – A sharp, calculating ruler appointed as regent when the previous king disappeared during the planar collision. Some believe she is biding her time before declaring herself queen outright.

# Golarion Islands

## Veyluna

**Drakes Landing:** The original landing site of Captain Drake, Drakes landing has grown into bustling city. Focused on diplomats and government the city still maintains a good degree of industry and acts as Golarions heart in the Isles.

**Steward:** **Lady Anessa Carthwyn** – A diplomat who seeks to mend relations with the Vey’Zyrenn but is caught between them and Golarion hardliners. Intelligent and shrewd, but not trusted by all.

## Port Nymara & the Crescent Isles

**Capital:** _Port Nymara_
   
**Description:** The largest and wealthiest island chain, dominated by trade, shipbuilding, and commerce. Port Nymara is the de facto capital of the region.
   
 **Steward:** **Duke Oren Valcourt** – A wealthy merchant-lord with ties to powerful trading guilds. Values profit above all and pushes for Golarion expansion, seeing the Azura Isles as an economic goldmine.

## Talon Cay & the Iron Reaches

 **Capital:** _Bastion’s Keep_
   
**Description:** A strategically located fortress isle guarding major sea routes. Home to the region’s military stronghold and a fleet tasked with securing Golarion interests.
   
 **Steward:** **General Cassia Vharen** – A pragmatic but fiercely loyal military leader. Maintains order with an iron grip and sees the Hastellen as a miltary campaign to wipe out. Would rather end the uneasy peace right now than be caught in a trap later.
 
## The Shard Isles – _The Wild Frontier_

**Capital:** _Stormwatch_
 
**Description:** A collection of smaller, less-settled islands where outlaws, smugglers, and independent settlers make their home. It’s a chaotic region, but also a crucial one for trade and exploration.
   
**Steward:** **Sir Eldric Hawthorne** – A former pirate-turned-privateer, placed in charge to keep the region under control. Keeps the peace through diplomacy and force in equal measure, but many suspect he still has ties to the criminal underworld.
