### **1. Magister Ilyan Merrow – The Silver Voice**

A master negotiator with an uncanny ability to speak three truths at once, Ilyan serves as the public face of the Circle. His silver tongue masks an iron will, and few know just how many rival pacts he's orchestrated—only to profit from both sides. He rarely raises his voice, but when he does, entire trade routes shift.

### **2. Admiral Vessa Nymari – The Tide’s Blade**

Formerly a sea captain turned admiral of the merchant fleets, Vessa commands with the quiet assurance of someone who has survived storms—both literal and political. Known for her unshakable calm and deep roots in Vey’Zyrenn nobility, she ensures the Circle’s naval convoys run on time and under protection. Some whisper she’s still loyal to her old family in the reef palaces below, while others say she’s preparing for war—just in case.

### **3. Kohran Delve – The Coinwright**

A grizzled Hastellen exile and financial alchemist, Kohran manages the Circle’s internal treasury and economic manipulation. He speaks in equations, not politics, and is rumored to have developed predictive models that flirt with chronomancy. Though abrasive and impatient, his insight has prevented more than one financial collapse. The other councilors tolerate him because, without Kohran, the books don’t balance—and neither does the city.

### **4. Selya Varune – The Whisperdancer**

Once a renowned courtesan and now a formidable intelligence broker, Selya knows more than she should. Her network of informants spans from the undertunnels of Veyluna Harbour to the personal letters of the Queen Regent. She dresses in layers of veils and pearls, each enchanted with subtle divination charms. To many, she is the Circle’s dark mirror: beautiful, dangerous, and essential.

### **5. Thassio Rell – The Coral Judge**

Thassio is the Circle’s arbiter of contracts and disputes. An ascetic Vey’Zyrenn cleric of Abadar and Gozreh, he views commerce as a sacred tide that must not be dammed nor left wild. Stoic and incorruptible, his courtroom is a sanctified reef amphitheater where arguments are resolved through ritual debate. Though he rarely speaks outside official sessions, his rulings echo with divine weight.

### **6. Garven Wint – The Dry-Dock Baron**

A barrel-chested Golarion shipwright who earned his seat through sheer force of influence over shipping infrastructure. Garven controls the dry-docks and arcane cranes that keep the Circle’s merchant fleet afloat. Blunt, practical, and proudly vulgar, he represents the labor unions and builders who keep Veyluna Centre running—though his rivals say he's too easily bribed with rare booze and promises of legacy.

---

### **7. Miraza Kel – The Tidebound Seer**

An enigmatic prophetess who claims to read the future in tide pools and spilled wine, Miraza occupies the most controversial seat. Her visions are cryptic but frighteningly accurate, and her vote is said to shift with the will of the tides. She rarely attends in person, instead sending coral statues animated with her voice and presence. Many fear her, a few worship her, and none understand her.

---

### **8. Varnin Cresthold – The Black-Quill Cartel**

A former smuggler-turned-legit trader, Varnin earned his seat by bringing rogue factions into Circle compliance. His caravans reach forbidden islands and dangerous planar rifts, always returning with profit—and sometimes curses. He speaks plainly, favors blunt deals, and keeps two shadowy enforcers at his side. While not trusted, his logistics expertise makes him irreplaceable.

### **9. Elestra Dawnmere – The Velvet Wave**

A poised and polite noblewoman from a minor elven house, Elestra represents the merchant aristocracy. She funds universities, subsidizes shipping ventures, and cultivates a network of young proteges throughout the Isles. While she avoids conflict, her honeyed diplomacy often unites divided councilors—and hides a ruthless instinct beneath a charitable smile. She's said to keep a poison ring for when the time comes.
