Im writing a DND/Pathfinder campaign set in the Azura Isles, a region affected by a planar collision caused by mining Manavine. The Azura Isles were settled in 703 after the discovery of Manavine, a gemstone rising to the surface due to tectonic activity. Isle Keltos was the first mining site, but harsh conditions led to its failure. Veyluna was settled soon after due to its good harbors, despite lacking Manavine. By 80 years later, Port Nymara had become a major trade hub. However, 8 years ago, magical storms reshaped the regionâ€”several islands vanished, and new ones appeared, bringing strange inhabitants. This was caused by a planar collision, as three factions had unknowingly mined the same Manavine vein across different planes. There are three factions: - **Golarions** (elves and humans, from the east, relying on manpower and sailing ships, with magic not fully integrated into society). The Golarion faction is governed by a Queen Regent who manages day-to-day affairs. She appoints five stewards, each representing a major island or island chain. - **Hastellen** (primarily dwarves, technologically advanced, rely on automatons). - **Vey'Zyrenn** (highly magical oceanic people, living in harmony with the sea, with both above-ground and underwater settlements).
The Campaign will feature the players arriving in the Azure Isles. Being recruited into the navy on an isle and doing a few simple quests exploring the new islands and the interactions with the factions. This is an opportunity to introduce the players to some of the main characters in the campaign. At somepoint the players will learn that they've been cut off from the mainland and they are in an isolated plane of existance. At this point they need to manage the problems arising from this and attempt to discover who's responsible and why for a the planar collision. Once the players discover who's responsible they'll need to take them down and fix it repairing the planar collision and finding someway to return the isles to the rightful place.
